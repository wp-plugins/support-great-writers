Sell Amazon products in the sidebar, based upon the POST or a default pool of products that you define.

== Description ==

The Amazon Book Store (formerly 'Support Great Writers') Widget provides a very simple way to sell Amazon products via a sidebar widget on your blog, magazine, or other WordPress-powered website.  The widget can be instantiated multiple times, with different products being displayed in each instance.  

You can sell specific products on specific pages of your website, or define a 'pool' of products from which the widget will randomly chose from.  This allows you to quickly build up an Amazon store of products that are related to your individual POSTs.  

== About Us ==

Developed by the fine folks at [Loudlever, Inc.](http://www.loudlever.com), this plugin allows blog owners and WordPress publishers to monetize their content through [Amazon affiliate sales](http://associates.amazon.com).  We believe that it should be as easy for site owners to use our tools, so if you experience any difficulties getting things set up please email us at: wordpress@loudlever.com. 

== Installation ==

**Install the Widget**

Install the plugin, then activate it.  Once activated, configure the Widget:

* First, drag the 'Amazon Book Store' widget to your sidebar. 
* Where prompted, set the "Title" you want displayed above the widget
* Input your Amazon "Affiliate ID" and the Country representing the affiliate program you belong to.  (Default is 'United States')
* Select how many product images you want displayed in the widget, 1 or 2.

**Configure the ASIN pool**

Navigate to 'Settings' -> 'Amazon Book Store' and add the ASINs for the products you want to be displayed in the widget.  See [What are ASINs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/seller/asin-upc-isbn-info.html) for more information.  There are two categorizations of settings:

* POST Specific:  If set, these products will be displayed when users are reading the designated POST.
* Default: If the request is to a POST that does not have specific ASINs defined, then the widget will display products from this group.

**Wow - that was easy!**

Yes -- it's that easy.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Use This Widget More Than Once In My Sidebar? =
Yes.  Absolutely.  Each instance can be configured separately.  Give the widgets separate titles - even separate Affiliate IDs.  You **must** use the same Affiliate 'country' for each widget instance, however.

== Screenshots ==

1. Widget displayed in the Widget manager.
2. Widget displayed in the Side-Bar (your styling may differ)
3. Widget process flow, illustrating how the products are selected for display
4. ASIN pool configuration for POSTs and for Default pool
