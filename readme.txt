Randomly display one or more Amazon products in the sidebar; products are selected from POST-specific pools, or from a 'default' pool that you define.

== Description ==

The Amazon Book Store (formerly 'Support Great Writers') Widget provides a very simple way to display up to two products in a sidebar widget on your blog, magazine, or other Wordpress-powered website.  The widget can be instantiated multiple times, with different products being displayed in each instance, enabling you to quickly add several products for sale to your site.

As of version 1.1.0, the you can define a 'pool' of products from which the widget will randomly pick up to two (per widget) for display.  You can also define a unique pool of products for use with an individual POST, allowing you to quickly build up an Amazon Book Store of products that are related to your POSTs.

== Installation ==

** Install the Widget **

Install the plugin, then activate it.  Once activated, configure the Widget:

* First, drag the 'Amazon Book Store' widget to your sidebar. 
* Where prompted, set the "Title" you want displayed above the widget
* Input your Amazon "Affiliate ID" and the Country representing the affiliate program you belong to.  (Default is 'United States')
* Select how many product images you want displayed in the widget, 1 or 2.

** Configure the ASIN pool **

Now navigate to 'Settings' -> 'Amazon Book Store' and add the ASINs for the products you want to be displayed in the widget.  There are two categorizations of settings:

* POST Specific:  If set, these products will be displayed when users are reading the designated POST.
* Default: If the request is to a POST that does not have specific ASINs defined, then the widget will display products from this group.

**Wow - that was easy!**

Yes -- it's that easy.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Use This Widget More Than Once In My Sidebar? =
Yes.  Absolutely.  Each instance can be configured separately.  Give them separate titles - even separate Affiliate IDs.  You **must** use the same Affiliate 'country' for each widget instance, however.

== Screenshots ==

1. Widget displayed in the Widget manager.
2. Widget displayed in the Side-Bar (your styling may differ)
3. Widget process flow, illustrating how the products are selected for display

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.1.0 =
* IMPORTANT: If you're upgrading from a previous version of the widget, please take note that the name of the widget has been changed from 'SupportGreatAuthors' to 'Amazon Book Store'.
* There is now a configuration management screen at 'Settings' -> 'Amazon Book Store' where you can define the default ASINs to display in the widget and/or associate specific ASINS to specific POSTs.
* This version delivers enhanced functionality and the ability to create a 'pool' of products which the widget will randomly select from.  Because of this functionality, when upgrading from a previous installed version, the plugin will do it's best to migrate your previous settings to the new configuration.  If you had multiple instances of the plugin installed in your sidebar, this migration may not work as smoothly as we'd hope.  Please check your configurations after installing.
