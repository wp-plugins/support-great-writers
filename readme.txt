Quickly add two products in a side-bar widget by using just adding the appropriate Amazon ASIN (ISBN-10) in the widget configuration screen. 

== Description ==
The Support Great Writers Widget is a very simple way to add products for sale in a box on the side-bar of your blog.  The widget can be instantiated multiple times, with different titles on each instance, enabling you to quickly add several products for sale on your site.


== Installation ==
After you install the plugin, you need to configure the Widget.   

* First, drag the "AmazonPostPurchase" widget to the appropriate side-bar container. 
* Where prompted, set the "Title" you want displayed above the widget
* Input two 10-digit ASIN codes from Amazon for the products you want displayed.
* Input your Amazon "Affiliate ID" where prompted

**Yes -- it's that easy!**

*PLEASE NOTE:* If you DO NOT add your own custom Associate ID, you WILL NOT get credit for any purchases made from people clicking on these products.  By default, this plugin uses our Affiliate Account ID -- so until you input your Affiliate Account ID, all referral $$ will go to us.  (If you're wishing to make a donation - there are easier ways to do it :) You have been warned!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Use This Widget More Than Once In My Sidebar? =
Yes.  Absolutely.  Each instance can be configured separately.  Give them separate titles, separate ASINs - even separate Affiliate IDs.
